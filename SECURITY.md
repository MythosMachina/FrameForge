# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Security updates are provided for the latest release on the `main` and
`majorupdate` branches. Older releases are not supported.

## Local-only deployment

FrameForge is intended for local use only. Do not expose it to the public
internet. At most, run it on a trusted LAN; never on WAN.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report security issues via GitHub Security Advisories:
https://github.com/MythosMachina/FrameForge/security/advisories

Include steps to reproduce, impact assessment, and any relevant logs or
proof-of-concept details. We will acknowledge receipt and follow up with
next steps as soon as possible.
