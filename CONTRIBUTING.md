# Contributing

Thanks for contributing to FrameForge.

## Workflow
- Create a dedicated branch for every change.
- Do not commit directly to `main`.
- Open a pull request from your branch with a clear summary.

## Guidelines
- Keep changes focused and small when possible.
- Add or update documentation when behavior changes.
- Prefer incremental improvements over large refactors.

## Reporting Issues
- Provide steps to reproduce.
- Include logs and environment details when relevant.
