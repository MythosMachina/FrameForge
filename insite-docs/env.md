# System basics (non-technical)

You do not need to manage servers to use FrameForge, but it helps to know the basics.

## Background services
FrameForge runs several background services:
- WebApp: the UI you use.
- Initiator: unpacks new uploads.
- Orchestrator: runs the main workflow.
- Finisher: packages results for download.

If any service is down, the Queue may stop. Use the System Status panel or ask an admin.
