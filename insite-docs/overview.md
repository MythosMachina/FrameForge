# Overview

FrameForge is a guided pipeline that turns ZIP uploads into clean, tagged image datasets. If you enable training, it also produces a LoRA and sample images.

Think of it like this:
- You upload raw images or video frames.
- FrameForge picks the best images, creates variations, and writes tags.
- You download the final dataset (and optional LoRA).

## Who is it for?
- Creators who want a clean dataset fast.
- Reviewers who check outputs and give feedback.
- Teams who want a repeatable, simple workflow.

## What you do (at a high level)
1. Upload ZIP(s).
2. Choose options (Autotag, AutoChar, Train, etc.).
3. Launch the run.
4. Watch Queue for progress.
5. Download results from History.

## Safety note
FrameForge is intended for local use. Do not expose it to the public internet.
