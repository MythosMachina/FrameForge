# FAQ

- Why does the RunID show up? It helps track runs; it is removed from final tags and downloads.
- Can I use CPU only? Yes, but it is slower. Training requires GPU.
- Can I upload multiple ZIPs? Yes, stage many and launch them together.
- Where do downloads appear? In History as Dataset/LoRA downloads.
- What if a run fails? Check the error in History; you can retry with a new upload.
- How do I improve tags? Use AutoChar presets and TagVerify for better color tags.
- Do I need models? Autotag downloads its model; training needs models installed by an admin.
- Can I pause a run? Manual Tagging pauses a run until you commit.
