# Status and Colors

The system status panel shows the health of background services.

## Colors
- Green (OK): service is running.
- Yellow (Busy/Waiting): service is working or waiting on work.
- Red (Fail): service is down or unresponsive.

## What to do if something is wrong
- If one service is red, wait a minute and refresh.
- If it stays red, ask an admin to restart the service.
- If the Queue is paused, runs will not start.
