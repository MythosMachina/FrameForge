# API (optional)

Most users never need the API. The WebApp already does everything you need.

If your team uses automation, these are common endpoints:
- GET /api/queue
- GET /api/history
- POST /api/upload
- DELETE /api/run/:id
- GET/POST/PUT/DELETE /api/autochar
- GET /api/settings
- GET /api/system/status

Ask an admin before using the API.
