# Web UI

- Upload: drop ZIPs, choose options, add a note, then Launch.
- Queue: live status for each run with step hints.
- History: finished runs, downloads, and delete button.
- AutoChar: edit preset rules used to remove unwanted tags.
- Settings: change defaults like FPS, selection size, and tag thresholds.
- Manual Tagging: review tags, edit captions, and commit to continue.

## Tips
- If you only review, you mainly use Queue and History.
- If a run is paused for manual tagging, it will not continue until you commit.
