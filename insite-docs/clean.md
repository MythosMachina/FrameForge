# Clean up and recovery

You can remove old runs and free space safely from the UI.

## Delete a run (safe)
- Open History.
- Click Delete on a run.
- This removes its files and DB entry.

## If a run is stuck
- Check System Status first.
- If a service is red, ask an admin to restart it.

## What not to do
- Do not delete files by hand unless you know what you are doing.
- Use the UI whenever possible.
