# Files and downloads

Most users only need the History tab for downloads. For reference:

## In the UI
- History shows finished runs.
- Each run has download links for dataset and (if trained) LoRA.

## On disk (for admins)
FrameForge stores files in local folders. Examples:
- Datasets: `OUTPUTS/datasets`
- LoRAs: `OUTPUTS/loras`
- ZIP downloads: `ARCHIVE/zips`

If you are not an admin, you can ignore this section.
